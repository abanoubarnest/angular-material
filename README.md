# SETUP and USAGE

The steps below will take you through cloning your own fork, installing dependencies and building:

```

2. Open your copied repo folder in terminal and install necessary modules with command, make sure that you have installed [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm):

```bash
npm install
```

3. Install [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) globally to use its commands in the terminal:

```bash
npm install --global @angular/cli
```

4. Now you are able to run or build the project:

Run `npm start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run build` or `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

# Quick start
Do you want to start quickly and don't need all the pages and modules? You can checkout to empty 
[starter-kit branch](https://github.com/CreativeIT/material-angular-dashboard/tree/starter-kit) and get to work!

If you need full-stack solution with authentication ability and routing, checkout
[feature/backend branch](https://github.com/CreativeIT/material-angular-dashboard/tree/feature/backend) with preconfigured Node.js backend.
You can also try the [demo](http://dashboard-auth-demo.creativeit.io) (user: admin@admin.admin , password: admin).

You can also try dashboard powered with [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). This allows you to easily deploy your application without the need for a dedicated server.
Checkout [feature/serverless branch](https://github.com/CreativeIT/material-angular-dashboard/tree/feature/serverless) to see the details or try the [demo](https://g5ope910kg.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/production/) (user: admin@admin.admin , password: admin) to make sure that this is no different from the classic approach.
